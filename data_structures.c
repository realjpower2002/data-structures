 * @author James Power
 * 
 * This file provides implementations for the function pointers in the data 
 * structures defined in "data_structures.h", as well as functions to construct 
 * the data structures. Currently, this includes :
 * 
 *     â€¢ LinkedList
 * 
 * These structs all are designed to accept void pointers to data as their 
 * contents. This means that any type of data can be stored in these data 
 * structure primitives, and it is up to the programmer to keep track of what 
 * type of data is being stored in which parts of the structure, and dereference 
 * the data properly.
 * 
 * These structures are designed to store heap data, allocated to pointers using 
 * malloc. For those of you who are not knowledgeable about program memory, be 
 * careful when trying to store stack variables in these structures. If the 
 * scope of a stack variable allocated in the list ends, you may not get the 
 * data that you expect when you access it again, as that memory address will 
 * very quickly be used for something else.
